<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I’m someone who’s shaped by both my personal journey and my cultural roots. 
  Growing up between different cultures taught me to be adaptable, open-minded, 
  and deeply curious about the world. 
  I value honesty, connection, and continuous growth — whether it’s through my relationships,
   my work, or learning something new. With a background in computer science, I’m drawn to the ways technology can bring people together and solve real-life problems.
    I care about doing meaningful work, staying grounded, and always learning from the people around me.</p>

<p>Te quiero mi vida Adrianita mi personna favorita y linda. </p>
